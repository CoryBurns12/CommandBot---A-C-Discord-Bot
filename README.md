# About the project

CommandBot is a discord bot that is multi-functional when it comes to the commands that it currently supports. I started this project for fun, but then it turned into something that I valued and thoroughly enjoyed creating.

# Supported Commands (Currently)
* !greet -> Greets the user when typed
* !cards -> Plays a game of war between the bot and the user (cards are randomized for both parties)
* !date -> Gets current date
* !rng -> Generates a random number that is kept secret by the bot
* !guess -> Allows the user to guess the number that is generated by typing [!rng]
* !joke -> Generates a random joke by the use of an API by using HTTP
* !rps -> Play Rock, Paper, Scissors with the discord bot
* !fact -> Generates a random fact by the use of an API by using RestSharp
