# About the project

CommandBot is a discord bot that is multi-functional when it comes to the commands that it currently supports. I started this project for fun, but then it turned into something that I valued and thoroughly enjoyed creating. It utilizes .NET which offers many more features along the way!

# Supported '!' Commands (Currently)
* !greet -> Greets the user when typed
* !cards -> Plays a game of war between the bot and the user (cards are randomized for both parties)
* !date -> Gets current date
* !joke -> Generates a random joke by the use of an API by using HTTP
* !rps -> Play Rock, Paper, Scissors with the discord bot
* !fact -> Generates a random fact by the use of an API by using RestSharp

# Supported '/' Commands (Currently)
* /Uptime -> Gets the uptime of the bot
* /rng -> Generates a random number
* /guess -> To use in unison with the '/rng' command. Allows you to guess the number generated
* /binary -> Allows the user to type a positive whole number which is converted to binary
* /binList
